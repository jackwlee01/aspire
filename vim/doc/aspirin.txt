*aspirin.txt* Plugin for navigating to and importing actionscript classes

First, add the paths of your ActionScript resources to g:as_locations. Aspirin can find classes and top-level functions from several sources:
* classes and top-level functions from a directory tree of ActionScript source
* classes from a swc file
* classes from all-classes.html from asdocs
* top-level functions from package-detail.html from an asdoc package

For example, adding

let g:as_locations = [
\ "~/Documents/flex3_langref/all-classes.html",
\ "~/Documents/flex3_langref/flash/utils/package-detail.html",
\ "~/dev/assemblage/aspirin/src/main/as"
]

to .vimrc would allow importing of the builtin classes and functions from Flash and the classes and top-level functions from aspirin.

After setting g:as_locations, imports and navigation will work.

Mappings:
<Leader>j or <Plug>AspirinJump
    Jump to the class or top-level function under the cursor

<Leader>i or <Plug>AspirinImport
    Add an import for the class or top-level function under the cursor
